/home/bi/shakespeare/Shakespeare/THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK.txt:      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
/home/bi/shakespeare/Shakespeare/THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK.txt:      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
/home/bi/shakespeare/Shakespeare/THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK.txt:    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
/home/bi/shakespeare/Shakespeare/THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK.txt:      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
